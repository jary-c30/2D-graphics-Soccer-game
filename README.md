# 2D-graphics-Soccer-game
A 2d graphics soccer game where you dodge obstacles while trying to dodge obstacles
The program I made is called ball control, the game is generally straight foward. The goal of the game is to 
move the blue rectangle(the soccerball) around obstacles without touching them, and without going out of bounds, 
your objective is to make it to the other side of the soccer field where the goal is (it's in red), the ENTIRE blue 
square MUST be touching the red barrier at the top of the field.
     rules:
      - Use W, A, S, D to move around the ball (UP, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT)
      - if you touch the purple obstacles or go out of bounds it will display a losing window
      - the entire top side of the blue square must be touching the red barrier at the top of the field
      - HAVE FUN!!!!!
